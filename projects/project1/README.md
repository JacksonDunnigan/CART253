Lucky Harvest by Jackson Dunnigan

Description
Lucky harvest is an arcade style farming simulator. The objective of this game
is to keep your plants healthy so they don't transform into monsters. If they do
transform into monsters, you can stomp on them to revert them back, but don't
let them hit you. Your score is based on how much corn you collect.
