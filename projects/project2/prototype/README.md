This is a very early version of foraging simulator. There isn't much gameplay at
the moment but a significant amount of the games framework is there. At the moment
you can just explore the randomly generated map and you will soon be able to
identify mushrooms using the field guide (at the bottom left). The end goal is to
make a survival game where you must forage the proper species of plants and mushrooms
to survive.
