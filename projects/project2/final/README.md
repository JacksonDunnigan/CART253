CART 253 Final
by Jackson Dunnigan

Foraging Simulator is a game where you play as a cute little fox and walk around
randomly generated woods looking for mushrooms to eat.

You walk with WASD and can pickup mushrooms by clicking on them. Press 1, or the
basket to access your inventory and press 2 or the book to access the field guide.
The field guide has information to identify all the mushrooms.

Unfortunately I ran out of time to add a hunger/health system, so the game is pretty
bare bones at the moment. But hopefully with what I have, I've showed a strong grasp
on the concepts learned in class.

NOTE: I added music but for some reason it only plays on certain browsers :(
